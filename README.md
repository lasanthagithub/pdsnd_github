Bay\_Area\_Bike\_Share\_Analysis.ipynb - Main project file.

babs\_datacheck.py; babs\_visualizations.py - Supplemental scripts for checking
data wrangling, reporting of basic statistics, and creation of exploratory bar
charts and histograms.

each. Prefixing each set is one of three datestamps, showing the end month for
each data collection period (201402, 201408, 201508). Suffixes for each file
indicate contents:

* README.txt - Information about contents of data files.

* station\_data.csv - Basic information about station locations and
capacities.

* trip\_data.csv - Information about each trip taken using the bike share
system.

* weather\_data.csv - Weather information by day for one station in each
city in the bike share program.
